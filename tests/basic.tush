# Basic tests

Here's a basic example of how tush should work.

```sh
$ echo '$ echo hello world'  >test.tush
```

```sh
$ tush-run test.tush
| $ echo hello world
| | hello world
```

`tush-check` should fail because we omitted the expected output in our
script:

```sh
$ tush-check test.tush >/dev/null
? 1
```

Same as above but expect the diff output.

```sh
$ tush-check test.tush
| --- test.tush expected
| +++ test.tush actual
| @@ -1 +1,2 @@
|  $ echo hello world
| +| hello world
? 1
```

Using `tush-bless` we fix this test failure:

```sh
$ tush-bless test.tush
$ tush-check test.tush
$ cat test.tush
| $ echo hello world
| | hello world
```

There should be nothing else in this tush-scratch directory we're running in:

```sh
$ ls
| test.tush
```
