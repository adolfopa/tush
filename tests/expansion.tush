# Input document expansion

When given the `-x` flag, `tush` should expand all shell variables
(`${VAR}` or `$VAR`) and command substitutions (`$(cmd)` and ``cmd``).

In the following example, the output references the `$HOME`
variable. This will be expanded as expected:

```sh
$ cd ~/bogus_dir
@ sh: line 0: cd: $HOME/bogus_dir: No such file or directory
? 1
```

Variable references with curly braces will also work:

```sh
$ cd ~/bogus_dir
@ sh: line 0: cd: ${HOME}/bogus_dir: No such file or directory
? 1
```

Command substitutions will also be expanded:

```sh
$ rm $(pwd)
@ rm: $(pwd): is a directory
? 1
$ rm `pwd`
@ rm: `pwd`: is a directory
? 1
```
