# Multiline commands

Tush is able to execute multiline commands, where each line except the
last one has a `\` as the last character:

```sh
$ echo first \
    second \
    third
| first second third
```

As with simple commands, multiline commands can be mixed with other
content:

```sh
This is a comment ...
$ echo a single line command
| a single line command
More content
    $ this is not a command
$ echo I am \
   multiline \
   really
| I am multiline really
$ echo a different command
| a different command
$ echo multiline \
   followed
| multiline followed
by regular content
